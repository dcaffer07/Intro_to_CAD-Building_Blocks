> - Use apply per ionmstance if necessary mate connectors are'nt showing up to endurepropper placement of parts.
> - Use the Snap Mode tool while connecting things for conveniance and auurance that all is in its correct spot.
> - Whern finding the mass of an entire object simply drag over the entire device for simplicity and conveniance.

> As I said it was a cool tyhing to get to see confi9gurations in real use and I look forward to making more in the future.
